# Secret Recipe Protection

A revolutionary confidential culinary technology platform that leverages Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to protect proprietary recipes and cooking formulas. This decentralized application enables chefs and culinary professionals to securely share their secret recipes while maintaining complete privacy and control over their intellectual property.

## 🔐 Core Concept

Secret Recipe Protection utilizes cutting-edge FHE smart contracts to create an unprecedented level of privacy for culinary creations. Chefs can encrypt their secret ingredients, cooking techniques, and proprietary formulas on-chain, allowing them to monetize their knowledge without revealing sensitive information until proper authorization is granted.

### Privacy-Preserving Culinary Innovation

Traditional recipe sharing platforms expose valuable culinary secrets to potential theft or unauthorized use. Our FHE-based solution ensures that:

- **Ingredient formulas remain encrypted** - Secret ingredient combinations are stored as encrypted values that cannot be read without proper access
- **Selective disclosure** - Chefs control exactly who can access their recipes and under what conditions
- **Verifiable ownership** - Blockchain technology provides immutable proof of recipe authorship and creation dates
- **Monetization without exposure** - Access requests can be processed with encrypted data, protecting formulas even during verification

## 🎯 Key Features

### For Culinary Professionals

- **Chef Registration** - Establish your verified identity as a culinary professional with specialty credentials
- **Encrypted Recipe Creation** - Store up to three secret ingredients as encrypted values alongside cooking parameters
- **Access Control Management** - Approve or deny access requests to your proprietary recipes
- **Revenue Generation** - Set custom pricing for recipe access and earn from your culinary expertise
- **Public/Private Toggle** - Choose whether recipes are openly viewable or require paid access

### For Food Enthusiasts

- **Recipe Discovery** - Browse available recipes from verified chefs across multiple cuisines
- **Secure Access Requests** - Pay to unlock secret formulas and techniques from professional chefs
- **Encrypted Data Handling** - All sensitive recipe information remains encrypted using FHE technology
- **Recipe Collections** - Build your personal library of licensed professional recipes

## 🔬 FHE Smart Contract Technology

The platform utilizes Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) smart contracts to enable computation on encrypted data without decryption. This breakthrough technology allows:

- **On-chain Privacy** - Secret ingredients stored as encrypted euint32 values
- **Encrypted Computations** - Spice levels and cooking parameters processed without exposure
- **Zero-Knowledge Verification** - Access control enforced without revealing recipe details
- **Permanent Confidentiality** - Even contract operators cannot view encrypted recipe data

### Encrypted Data Types

- **Secret Ingredients** - Three encrypted uint32 values for proprietary ingredient codes
- **Spice Level** - Encrypted uint8 value (0-10 scale) for heat sensitivity
- **Cooking Time** - Encrypted uint32 for precise timing information
- **Access Permissions** - Encrypted boolean flags for authorization status
